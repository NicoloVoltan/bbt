# Excel Spreadsheets

FiniteFields.xlsm uses VBA code to generate the tables of
opposite, inverse, and square roots for every element in Fp.

EC* are elliptic curve on real numbers and Fp:
the naming pattern is EC(a,b)-Fp-G(x,y)-NX.xlsm
where (a,b) are the elliptic curve equation coefficients,
Fp the finite field,
(x,y) the generator point,
and X the cardinality of the EC(Fp) group.

Calc equivalent speadsheet might be ready soon... feel free to contribute them.
